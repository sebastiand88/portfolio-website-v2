        I'm Sebastian Damian, a self-taught web developer based in Glasgow.
        After 10+ years of working in hospitality I decided to change my career;
        and what better field for me to choose from than a career in web
        development as I've been passionate about computers and new technology
        all my life. So I decided to give coding a try.
